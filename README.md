# Online_book_reader_Cpp_OOP

I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on â€“ an Online Book Reader! ðŸ“–âœ¨

**Key Features:**
- User Authentication
- Admin and User Modes
- Book Management
- User-Friendly Reading Interface

 **How It Works:**
1. Users can log in or sign up to access the Online Book Reader.
2. Admins have special privileges like viewing profiles and adding new books to the collection.
3. Users can explore available books, view their profiles, and enjoy a seamless reading experience.

 **Project Highlights:**
- Secure user authentication
- Dynamic book management system
- Intuitive and engaging user interface

 **Technical Approach:**
I was particularly interested in utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to enhance the project's organization and efficiency. This approach not only improves code structure but also makes future enhancements and additions more seamless.
